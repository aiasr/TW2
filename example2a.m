%  Instructions
%  ------------
%
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     pca.m
%     projectData.m
%     recoverData.m
%     computeCentroids.m
%     findClosestCentroids.m
%     kMeansInitCentroids.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% =================== Part 3: K-Means Clustering ======================
%  After you have completed the two functions computeCentroids and
%  findClosestCentroids, you have all the necessary pieces to run the
%  kMeans algorithm. In this part, you will run the K-Means algorithm on
%  the example dataset we have provided. 
%
fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on example dataset.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset
load('ex7data2.mat');

% Settings for running K-Means
K = 3;% original 3, auch mal auf 5 stzen
max_iters = 10;

% For consistency, here we set centroids to specific values
% but in practice you want to generate them automatically, such as by
% settings them to be random examples (as can be seen in
% kMeansInitCentroids).
initial_centroids = [3 3; 6 2; 8 5]; %Original
%initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K); % Generic instruction

% Run K-Means algorithm. The 'true' at the end tells our function to plot
% the progress of K-Means
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, true);
fprintf('\nK-Means Done.\n\n');
